This is a Chef cookbook file. It is used to copy content verbatim on to a server.
For dynamic or otherwise data-driven content, please see sample.erb in the templates/
directory for an example of using a template resource.

You can create a cookbook_file resource in a recipe file:

    cookbook_file "/etc/myserver.conf" do
      source "sample.txt"
      owner "root"
      group "root"
      mode "644"
    end

A cookbook_file resource can be used with any context, including binary files.

For further information, see the Chef documentation (https://docs.chef.io/essentials_cookbook_files.html).
